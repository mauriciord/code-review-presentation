        <Appear>
            <li>
              Technical facts and data replace opinions and personal preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
              The style guide is the absolute authority. If there is no previous style, accept the authorâ€™s.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aspects of software design are almost never a pure style issue or just a personal preference.
